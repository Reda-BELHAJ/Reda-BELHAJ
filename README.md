## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

<br>

BELHAJ Reda: Computer Science Student at the International University of Rabat.

ðŸ˜€ Ever since I was a kid, Computer science has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of my Desktop loading some "Hello, World!" Tutorials, It was almost magic, being able to get the computers to do whatever I program it to do.

ðŸ’™ This passion still carries me through my education at the International University of Rabat. There were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid, I study new languages, algorithms, compilers, technologies, operating systems, and mathematics.
